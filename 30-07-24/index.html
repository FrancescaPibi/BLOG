Today I officially completed my first project.
I copied the home page of a very simple website (in this case cyclist Elisa Balsamo's).

The structure I chose for the head is:
1. <title>
2. <meta> data ("descriptive")
3. <meta> data ("functional")
4. <link(s)>: internal and external resources

For now, the body contains only one section with:
1. <header> 
    - page title
    - page subtitle
2. <nav> to be inteded as the navigation bar
    - links relating to the page
    - languages the website can be viewed in (IT, ENG)

In the CSS style sheet I added style to:
- body 
- section
- header
- nav 
- <a> tags

I also imported a font from Google.com!
