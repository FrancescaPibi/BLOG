My first day was dedicated to learning what Version Control Systems (VCS) and Repo Hosting Services are.
Today the most commonly used VCS is Git. In comparison to past VCS, Git is distributed, meaning that the full history of a code repository can be stored in multiple places, and by mutliple developers. 
In the past, VCS were centralized, which meant that only one place could store the full history of a code repository.

In order to use Git as efficiently as possible, Repo Hosting Services were created. The most famous ones are GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket. 
I decided to use GitHub because it is the most commonly used one. 
On GitHub, I first created an account, and then, by using the terminal, I created my first repository.
Still using the terminal, I played with it a bit, trying to explore as much as possible. I learnt the following commands:

git init
git remote add git@github.com:<username>/<repository>.git
git push -u origin master (or main)

git add <file(s)> 
git add . 

git commit -m "describing message"
git commit --amend "new describing message"

git push
git pull

git checkout -b <name of new branch>
git checkout master (or main)

git status
git log --oneline

git rm <file(s)>
git remote rm origin
