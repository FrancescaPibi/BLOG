My first day was dedicated to learning what Version Control Systems (VCS) and Repo Hosting Services are.
Today the most commonly used VCS is Git. In comparison to past VCS, Git is distributed, meaning that the full history of a code repository can be stored in multiple places, and by mutliple developers. 
In the past, VCS were centralized, which meant that only one place could store the full history of a code repository.

In order to use Git as efficiently as possible, Repo Hosting Services were created. The most famous ones are GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket. 
I decided to use GitHub because it is the most commonly used one. 
On GitHub, I first created an account, and then, by using the terminal, I created my first repository.
Still using the terminal, I played with it a bit, trying to explore as much as possible. I learnt:
- how to create a branch

git 

- how to add a README.md file

git add README.md

- what md stands for (Markdown Documentation) and how to use a markdown language

- how to make a change 

git commit -m "message describing the change"

- how to push the change to the main branch

git push

- how to use git status 

git status
