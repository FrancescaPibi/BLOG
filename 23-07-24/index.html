Today was the day for semantic HTML. 
Semantic HTML, beyond conveying the correct appearance of a web page, describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of semantic HTML elements are:
<header></header>
<footer></footer>
<main></main>
<article></article>
<aside></aside>
<nav></nav>
Using semantic HTML is thought to be a "best practice" in order to write clean and understandable code.
Therefore, instead of falling into the habit of using <div(s)> all the time, as many developers happen to do, I will use using semantic HTML elements.

Secondly, I started my first project: making a copy of a very basic website.
The website I've chosen is Elisa Balsamo's blog.
She is an Italian professional cyclist, and as such, very relevant to me and my ambitions in cycling.

I opened another HTML file, wrote down the <head> with the knowledge I had acquired the previous days.
In the head I put: <title>, <meta> data, <link(s)>.
Afterwards, I moved on to the <body>.  
In the body I added a <header> and a <nav> tag.
