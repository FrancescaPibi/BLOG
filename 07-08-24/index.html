Today I learnt about HTML forms.
An HTML form is used to collect user input. The input is usually then sent to a server for processing.

There are form elements and form attributes.
Some of the most common form elements are:
<input>
<button>
<label>
<option>
<select>

Some of the most common form attributes are:
action
target
method
autocomplete
novalidate


In addition, there are different types of <input>. Some of them are:
<input type="text">
<input type="date">
<input type="color">
<input type="email">

The <input> element also has specific attributes, such as:
value
readonly
disabled
multiple
pattern
placeholder
