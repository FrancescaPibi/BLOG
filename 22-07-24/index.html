Today I finished going through the very basics of HTML, according to W3Schools' website.
The topics I focused on were:

links <a href="https://www.google.it/">This is Google research page.</a>
images (including favicon) <img src="" alt="" width="200" height="300">
tables 
lists (ul, ol, dl) - li (list item)
block (<div>, <p>) and inline (<span>, <a>) display values
CSS specificity (very superficially for now): in order of specificity, inline CSS, id (1,0,0), class (0,1,0), element (0,0,1)
div = "divides a section of a web page
class = attribute (.class)
id = attribute (#id)
semantic HTML (header, footer, aside, article, main, mark, etc)
U-8 charset
entities, symbols, emojis
