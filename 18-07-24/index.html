Today I learnt the very basics about HTML.
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the language most web pages are written in.
HTML tells the browser how to display the content of web pages.

In order to go through the basics I relied mainly on W3Schools. 
While reading throught the content, I applied it to my codebase.

Elements and tags; example: <h1></h1>
Attributes; example: <img src="dadada" alt="alternative text"></img>
Headings and paragraphs; example: <h3></h3> <p></p>
Styles; example: <p style="font-size:60px;color:aliceblue"></p>
Formatting: example: <h3><b>This text is bold</b></h3>

I also learnt how to make my email responsive:
<a href="mailto:franci.pibi@gmail.com?subject:Hello&body:How are you?"></a>
